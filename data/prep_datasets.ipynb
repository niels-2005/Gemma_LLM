Then I plan to compile it into a C library and use SWIG to create a Python wrapper. At that point, I should be able to call the simulation from a small Django app. At least I hope so.\n",

It simply wraps it into a standalone executable or a library with its own runtime engine that runs it.  You would be able to run your code without Matlab installed, and you would be able to interface it with other languages, but it will still be interpreted Matlab code, so there would be no speedup.\n"
