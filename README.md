# Gemma Fine-Tuning Project

Welcome to the Gemma Fine-Tuning Project repository! This project showcases the fine-tuning of Gemma, Google AI's powerful language model with 2 billion parameters, on a curated dataset of 22,000 Python question and answer pairs. Our aim is to enhance Gemma's ability to understand and generate Python-related content.


## Project Overview

Gemma, initially designed for a broad range of language understanding tasks, has been fine-tuned to specifically address Python programming questions.


### Dataset Preparation

The dataset comprises 22,000 Python Q&A pairs, meticulously prepared to ensure relevance and accuracy. 
Given the computational constraints, particularly GPU memory limits, we optimized the dataset for a maximum sequence length of 256 tokens. This constraint required precise data preprocessing to fit within the model's capacity, highlighting the challenge of working within hardware limitations.


### Training Configuration

Due to the aforementioned GPU memory limitations, the fine-tuning process was conducted with a batch size of 1. 
This constraint underscores the project's exploratory nature, serving as a starter template for those interested in fine-tuning large language models under resource constraints. 
Despite these limitations, the project aims to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of model specialization on specific domains like Python programming.


## Objectives

- **Enhance Gemma's Python Proficiency**: Tailor the model to better understand and generate responses to Python-related inquiries, making it a valuable resource for coding and educational purposes.
- **Demonstrate Fine-Tuning on a Specific Domain**: Provide insights into the process of fine-tuning a large language model on a specialized dataset, offering a blueprint for similar endeavors.
- **Explore Training under Constraints**: Highlight the challenges and solutions when fine-tuning advanced models with limited computational resources.

## Conclusion

This project is a step towards creating more specialized AI tools that can support specific fields and interests.
